title=Reactive Maps
description=This template and tutorial shows how the Typesafe Reactive Platform can be used to implement scalable, resilient, responsive event driven apps.  The application shows the location of every user currently connected on a map, updated in real time.  Akka clustering with distributed pub sub allows it to scale horizontally, we tested with 50000 simulated concurrent users, each sending position updates every second, on 10 nodes on Google Compute Engine.  The in context tutorial guides you through design features and code of the app, and then gently introduces you to some of the more detailed topics with instructions for adding new features.
